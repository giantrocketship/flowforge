- **New dependency**: `ext-bcmath` PHP extension required
- **Removed**: `Rank.php` service (Lexorank algorithm)
- **Laravel version**: Now requires Laravel 12+

### Added

- `DecimalPosition` service with BCMath-based position calculations
- `PositionRebalancer` service for automatic gap management

- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff (50ms, 100ms, 200ms)
- `MaxRetriesExceededException` for conflict handling
- `flowforge:diagnose-positions` command - detect gaps, inversions, duplicates
- `flowforge:rebalance-positions` command - redistribute positions evenly
- Support for custom primary keys via `getKeyName()`

- `UPGRADE.md` migration guide for v2.x users

### Changed

- Position algorithm from Lexorank (string) to DecimalPosition (decimal)
- Blueprint macro `flowforgePositionColumn()` now creates `DECIMAL(20,10)`
- `flowforge:repair-positions` command now interactive with multiple strategies

### Removed

- `Rank.php` service
